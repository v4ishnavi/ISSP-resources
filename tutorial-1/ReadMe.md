# Tutorial 1 
* discrete random variable
* continuous random variable
* random vector
* random process
* stationary vs non stationary process
* example 1: Asin(wn + r) where r ~ U[-pi, pi]
* stationary processes: strict sense stationary vs wide sense stationary
* Ergodic process
* discrete time Fourier transform + power spectral density of a random signal
* white noise
* a system  { x[n] -> h[n] --> y[n] }
